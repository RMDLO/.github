<h2 align="center"> Representing and Manipulating Deformable Linear Objects </h2>
<h3 align="left"> Introduction </h3>
This is the GitHub organization home page for the Representing and Manipulating Deformable Linear Objects (RMDLO) project from the <a href="https://bretl.csl.illinois.edu">Bretl Research Group</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project studies robotic manipulation, grasp planning, tactile sensing, segmentation, simulation, and tracking of wires and ropes.
<br/><br/>
Our growing hardware stack comprises software for controlling two ABB IRB120 6DOF robotic manipulators, a Rethink Robotics Sawyer 7DOF manipulator, the Intel RealSense d435 camera, the ZED Mini camera, and the DIGIT tactile sensor. For any project-related inquiries or requests, please contact  <a href="hdinkel2@illinois.edu">Holly Dinkel</a>.
